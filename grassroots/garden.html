<dl>There are two major approaches to managing a community
garden:</dl>
<dt>Individual Plots</dt>
<dd>In the individual plot approach, the garden is subdivided
for personal use, similar to the “allotment” system common
in the United Kingdom. Individual plots can be chosen,
randomly selected, or assigned. Individual plot management is often used for vegetable gardening.</dd><br>
<dt>Common Greenspace</dt>
<dd>In the common greenspace approach, garden members
cooperate in managing one area. Often, each member
is responsible for a set of tasks within the shared area.
garden types. Some examples include ornamental landscapes, educational gardens,
and entrepreneurial gardens. Ornamental landscapes are pocket parks meant to inspire
community beautification in order to clean-up degraded
urban landscapes. Educational gardens can be used for
job training, horticultural demonstrations, or outdoor
classrooms. The goal of entrepreneurial gardens is to sell
the products from the garden and share the profits among
members.</dd>
